		<!-- KEY							DESCRIPTION -->
		<!-- ===							=========== -->
		<!-- ControlServer					Indicates the IP Address and port where the Control Server is listening.  The Control -->
		<!--								Server will return a Client, Store, Hierarchy, and Application Server where remote -->
		<!--								sessions can be created.  If this key is not assigned, all sessions will be created -->
		<!--								locally (in the address space of the client) -->
		<!-- LocalStoreServer				"True" or "Yes" indicate the Store Session is to be created locally -->
		<!-- LocalHierarchyServer			"True" or "Yes" indicate the Hierarchy Session is to be created locally -->
		<!-- LocalApplicationServer			"True" or "Yes" indicate the Application Session is to be created locally -->
		<!-- User							The ID of the user to log into the application with -->
		<!-- Password						The password of the user -->
		<!-- InputFile						The directory and name of the input transactions -->
		<!-- RollStockForward				This option identifies that all ending stock values are to be rolled to beginning stock  -->
		<!-- SerializeXMLFile				This option identifies that the XML input file can be serialized.   -->
		<!--								This option should only be enabled if sufficient resources are available. -->
		<!-- AllowAutoAdds					This option identifies that the process should attempt to add a product if not defined.   -->
		<!-- Delimiter						If the InputFile is delimited, indicates the character used to separate -->
		<!--								each field in the transaction. -->
		<!-- CommitLimit					The commit limit for the database activity.  Use "UNLIMITED" for a single database transaction. -->
		<!-- RollStoreDailyToWeekly			This option identifies that the process is to generate rollup requests for this type of item. -->
		<!-- 								The rollup process must then be run to complete the rollup process. -->
		<!-- RollStoreDailyUpHierarchy		This option identifies that the process is to generate rollup requests for this type of item. -->
		<!-- 								The rollup process must then be run to complete the rollup process. -->
		<!-- RollStoreWeeklyUpHierarchy		This option identifies that the process is to generate rollup requests for this type of item. -->
		<!-- 								The rollup process must then be run to complete the rollup process. -->
		<!-- RollStoreToChain				This option identifies that the process is to generate rollup requests for this type of item. -->
		<!-- 								The rollup process must then be run to complete the rollup process. -->
		<!-- RollChainUpHierarchy			This option identifies that the process is to generate rollup requests for this type of item. -->
		<!-- 								The rollup process must then be run to complete the rollup process. -->
		<!-- RollIntransit					This option identifies that the process is to generate rollup requests for this type of item. -->
		<!-- 								The rollup process must then be run to complete the rollup process. -->
		<!-- ComputationModel				This option identifies the model to use to determine if computations must be executed after posting. -->
		<!-- 								The computation process must then be run to complete the process. -->
		<!-- ReaderLockTimeOut				The amount of time in milliseconds to hold a read lock on data -->
		<!-- WriterLockTimeOut				The amount of time in milliseconds to hold a write lock on data -->
		<!-- DatabaseCommandTimeOut			Optional - The time (in seconds) to wait for the command to execute. The default is 30 seconds. -->
		<!-- DatabaseRetryCount				Optional - The number of times to retry a database call before failing the call. The default is 4 times.-->
		<!--								This can be set to 0 if you do not want the application to attempt to retry the call. -->
		<!-- DatabaseRetryInterval			Optional - The time (in milliseconds) to wait between retry attempts. The default is 2000 (2 seconds). -->
		<!-- AuditLoggingLevel				Optional - Identifies the message level at which logging is to begin. Valid levels are listed below. -->
		<!--								The default is Edit. -->
		<!--								Debug -->
		<!--								Information -->
		<!--								Edit -->
		<!--								Warning -->
		<!--								Error -->
		<!--								Severe -->
		<!-- TransactionHint				Optional - Identifies the hierarchy level of products found in the transactions.  This is a performance tuning option.  -->
		<!--								This does not limit the transactions to only the levels specified.  It optimizes the processing of the products -->
		<!--								that meet the criteria.  The default is All. -->
		<!--								All - identifies there may be products at all hierarchy levels.  This is the least amount of optimization. -->
		<!--								StyleAndAbove - identifies products are at or obove the style hierarchy level. -->
		<!--								Color - identifies products are at the color hierarchy level. -->
		<!--								Size - identifies products are at the color hierarchy level. -->
